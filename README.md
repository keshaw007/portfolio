## About Me

In this section, I introduce myself and provide a brief overview of my background, education, and professional journey. Feel free to explore this section to get to know me better.
Hi, I'm Keshaw Kumar, a final-year Computer Science Engineering student at IIIT Nagpur with a passion for programming and problem-solving. I have a strong foundation in core programming concepts and a desire to continue learning and growing in the ever-evolving field of technology.

Up to this point in my academic career, I have worked on a variety of projects that have helped me to refine my skills in software development, data structures and algorithms, web development, ML, Cloud Computing, etc. I am skilled in front-end web development tools including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as programming languages like C, C++ and Python. I am also a ML enthusiast and have very little experience in the cyber security domain.
